    <h3>Physical Therapy program</h3>

    <article> "The physical therapy technician program helps students learn more in depth about the rehabilitation
        field.
        While
        the focus is on physical therapy, we also talk about occupational therapy, athletic training and other jobs in
        the medical field. A physical therapy technician helps assist a physical therapist in administering care to
        patients. That care is typically given via therapeutic exercise. A technician's role is to ensure that the
        exercise is completed properly with the correct modifications or progressions. Being a physical therapy
        technician is a very rewarding job assisting patients in tasks that they once could not do."

    <p id="define"> Physical Therapy the treatment of disease, injury, or deformity by physical methods such as massage,
        heat
        treatment, and exercise
        rather than by drugs or surgery.
        This program helps and teach our students how to become techniques and be ready for future jobs.
        Like most atheletes and people that have serious accidents have personal physical therapy technicians to help
        them get back the ablilities they could have lost.</p>
